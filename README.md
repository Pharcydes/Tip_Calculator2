# Tip_Calculator2
###Made a simple tip calculator that splits among x number of people
Pretty straight forward you input how much your bill is 
Then you input tip as either 10% 12% or 15%
Next you input number of people splitting the bill
Once that's done it will give total rounded to 2 decimal places.

Part of tutorial series 100 days code this is not the same exact code just remixed in my own way.
